## üìÇ **Academic Projects**

### 1. **Imputing Missing Portions of MRI Scans**
- **Description**:
  - Developed a neural network architecture to recover missing portions of MRI images of human heads.
  - This addressed a key imputation problem in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) where incomplete scans prevent detailed patient analysis. 
- **Technologies**: Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Data**:
  - Artificially generated realistic MRI images for model training (using a pre-trained generative model).
  - Corrupted MRI images stored in test_set.npy (100 images of size 64x64 pixels).
- **Approach**:
  - Designed a neural network to learn from artificially-generated datasets.
  - Implemented preprocessing pipelines to apply corruption mask to clean MRI image data for training. 
  - Trained and evaluated a U-net architecture.
- **Results**:
  - Successfully reconstructed missing portions of MRI images:

### 2. **Time Series Weather Data Imputation**
- **Description**:
  - Developed a neural network to recover missing daily weather measurements from sequential time-series data.
  - Addressed corrupted weather data over multiple decades, using both clean and corrupted datasets for training and testing.
- **Technologies**: Python, LSTM/Transformer models, Pandas, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Data**:
  - ***Training***:  
    - training_set_0.csv, training_set_1.csv, training_set_2.csv (corrupted).
    - training_set_0_nogaps.csv, training_set_1_nogaps.csv, training_set_2_nogaps.csv (clean versions).
  - ***Testing***:
    - test_set.csv (corrupted time-series data for one unseen decade).
  - ***Variables***:
    - cloud_cover, sunshine, global_radiation, max_temp, mean_temp, min_temp, precipitation, pressure.
- **Approach**:
  -Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)to visualize time-series trends and compare clean vs. corrupted data.
    - Created line plots for each variable across 365 days to highlight gaps.
    - Generated histograms to show distribution shifts due to corruption.
  - Preprocessing pipeline to handle differently distributed data for model stability.
  - Investigate several models like RNNS, LSTMs and Transformer architectures for time-series data imputation. LSTM model was ultimately selected due to time constraints to tune the highly parameter-sensitive transformer. 
	- Implemented an LSTM-based neural network to capture temporal dependencies and impute missing measurements.
	- Trained the model using corrupted inputs and clean targets.
	- Validated on unseen test data to evaluate recovery performance.

- **Results**:
  - Successfully imputed missing values across all weather variables with high accuracy:
