## üìÇ **Academic Projects**

### 1. **Imputing Missing Portions of MRI Scans**
- **Description**:
  - Developed a neural network architecture to recover missing portions of MRI images of human heads.
  - This addressed a key imputation problem in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) where incomplete scans prevent detailed patient analysis. 
- **Technologies**: Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Data**:
  - ***Training***:Artificially generated realistic MRI images for model training (using a pre-trained generative model).
  - ***Testing***: Corrupted MRI images stored in test_set.npy (100 images of size 64x64 pixels).
- **Approach**:
  - Created preprocessing pipelines to apply corruption masks to clean MRI images for supervised learning.
  - Designed and trained a U-Net architecture on the corrupted and clean MRI images.
  - Evaluated model performance on unseen corrupted MRI images to measure reconstruction accuracy.
- **Results**:

### 2. **Time Series Weather Data Imputation**
- **Description**:
  - Developed a neural network to recover missing daily weather measurements from sequential time-series data.
  - Addressed corrupted weather data over multiple decades, using both clean and corrupted datasets for training and testing.
- **Technologies**: Python, LSTM/Transformer models, Pandas, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Data**:
  - ***Training***:  
    - training_set_0.csv, training_set_1.csv, training_set_2.csv (corrupted).
    - training_set_0_nogaps.csv, training_set_1_nogaps.csv, training_set_2_nogaps.csv (clean versions).
  - ***Testing***:
    - test_set.csv (corrupted time-series data for one unseen decade).
  - ***Variables***:
    - cloud_cover, sunshine, global_radiation, max_temp, mean_temp, min_temp, precipitation, pressure.
- **Approach**:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)to visualize time-series trends and compare clean vs. corrupted data.
    - Created line plots for each variable across 365 days to highlight gaps.
    - Generated histograms to show distribution shifts due to corruption.
  - Preprocessing pipeline to handle differently distributed data for model stability.
  - Investigated several models like RNNS, LSTMs and Transformer architectures for time-series data imputation. LSTM model was ultimately selected due to time constraints to tune the highly parameter-sensitive transformer. 
  - Implemented an LSTM-based neural network to capture temporal dependencies and impute missing measurements.
  - Trained the model using corrupted inputs and clean targets.
  - Validated on unseen test data to evaluate recovery performance.
- **Results**:

### 3. **Predicting Significant Wave Heights**
- **Description**:
  - Built a regression model to predict significant wave heights (Hsig) based on environmental and oceanic conditions.
  - The project involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation using performance metrics. 
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Data**: Hsig (wave height), Temperature, Wind Speed, Wave Direction, Depth, and seasonal/categorical features.
- **Approach**:
  - Preprocessed data using pipelines (handling missing values, encoding, and transformations).
	- Trained a baseline Linear Regression model as a benchmark.
  - Optimized ensemble models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) using RandomizedSearchCV with cross-validation.
	- Evaluated model performance using R¬≤ and Mean Squared Error (MSE) metrics.

### 4. **Predicting Passenger Transportation**
- **Description**:
  - Developed a classification model to predict whether passengers were successfully transported based on personal and travel-related features.
  - The project included model comparison, threshold tuning, and error analysis. 
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
- **Data**: Age, VIP, RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Cabin, HomePlanet, Destination, CryoSleep, Transported (True/False).
- **Approach**:
  - Compared Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models.
	- Tuned hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV with cross-validation.
  - Evaluated performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC.
	- Adjusted thresholds to minimize error in two scenarios:
    - Balanced trade-off between False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN).
    - Prioritized minimizing False Negatives.
